# MiniNaim

I am passionate about creating innovative, problem-solving, and beautiful UI front-end design.

I design & develop User Interfaces with CSS3, HTLM5, JS, and Responsiveness. 

Page loading speed, display performance, responsive layout, and SEO optimizations are part of my job, I take these issues at heart from the very beginning. 

I strive to offer a professional experience with a personal connection.
